- move functions to mu/utils
- remove model
- store rudder/elevetor/aileron configs and change them by keyboard
- add: aileron applies torque
- add: aileron adds drag
- add: elevetor adds lift and drag
- add: engine reduces fuel as function of engine speed
- when switch tracking of aircraft, turn off the audio for current aircraft
- hear nearby aircrafts' sounds
- calculate camera distance based on aircraft size
- refactor rendering
	- box should be turned into list of lines (remove its shader)
- ground objects:
	- heathrow: totally broken ground objects rotations
	- heathrow: STATION has incorrect AABB (always intersects with everything)
- mac: fix change line width
- shade using normals
- render terrain texture
- fog

- what to do with StartInfo::speed if it's always calculated/overwritten?
- tornado.dnm/f1.dnm: strobe lights and landing-gears not in their expected positions
- viggen.dnm: right wheel doesn't rotate right
- cessna172r has a hidden beacon
- f1(?) has one beacon on right but not on left
- concorde.dnm loading is slow
- concorde.dnm has flickering triangles
- render ZL: create texture image instead of rwlight.png (similar to https://ysflightsim.fandom.com/wiki/SRF_Files)
- which ground to render if multiple fields?
- Scenery
	- small.fld bugs:
		- biggest pic doesn't render/(tesselat?) correctly (from left side)
	- at end of FLD, what is PLT vs PC2? they both refer to Pict2 (!)
	- terrmesh sides colors
	- read PST at end of fld
	- aomori.fld:
		- what is BASEELV?
		- what is MAGVAR?
		- what is CANRESUME?
		- what is APL?
		- read TEXMAN
		- read TXL/TXC
		- render texture
		- what is AOB?
		- read AIRROUTE
		- failed to tesselate
	- what is DST in heathrow.fld pictures ?
- what's PAX in dnmver 2?
- what are GE and ZE in hurricane.dnm?
- what are GL in cessna172r.dnm?
- what do if REL DEP not in dnm?
- fix render land texture (now it's half-assed)
- use coll.dnm files
- figure out how to IPO the landing gear (angles in general), no it's not slerp or lerp
- animate landing gear transition in real time (no alpha)
- axis
	- show axis labels
	-? select mesh/object
	-? move selected (translation of axis)
	-? rotate selected
- all rotations as quaternions
-? AABB for each mesh
-? AABB -> OBB
-? view normals (geometry shader)
-? strict integers tokenization

- optimization:
	- use smaller kinds of opengl primitives (i.e. strip/fan)

- audio:
    - mixing anything with propoller isn't loud enough
    - don't use SDL_MixAudioFormat (why :D)
    - what to do with multiple playbacks of same sound? (ignore new? increase volume unlimited? increase volume within limit? ??)
    - use silence.wav to get correct silence value dynamically?

- parser:
    -? read from disk
