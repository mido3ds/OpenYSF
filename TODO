- ground objects templates

- mac: fix change line width
- render aircraft vectors:
	- weight
	- air lift
	- prop/engine power dir
	- total power
	- velocity
	- render names of each line
- when switch tracking of aircraft, turn off the audio for current aircraft
- hear nearby aircrafts' sounds
- calculate camera distance based on aircraft size
- tornado.dnm/f1.dnm: strobe lights and landing-gears not in their expected positions
- viggen.dnm: right wheel doesn't rotate right
- cessna172r has a hidden beacon
- f1(?) has one beacon on right but not on left
- concorde.dnm loading is slow
- concorde.dnm has flickering triangles
- render ZL
	- create texture image instead of rwlight.png (similar to https://ysflightsim.fandom.com/wiki/SRF_Files)
- which ground to render if multiple fields?
- put lines coords in shader
- put box coords in shader
- Scenery files
	- read GOB at end of fld
	- add dnm GOBs to field
	- add srf GOBs to field (turn it into dnm?)
	- small.fld bugs:
		- biggest pic doesn't render/(tesselat?) correctly (from left side)
	- at end of FLD, what is PLT vs PC2? they both refer to Pict2 (!)
	- terrmesh sides colors
	- read PST at end of fld
	- aomori.fld:
		- what is BASEELV?
		- what is MAGVAR?
		- what is CANRESUME?
		- what is APL?
		- read TEXMAN
		- read TXL/TXC
		- render texture
		- what is AOB?
		- read AIRROUTE
		- failed to tesselate
	- what is DST in heathrow.fld pictures ?
	- hot reload file?
	- meshes imgui in field?
- what's PAX in dnmver 2?
- what are GE and ZE in hurricane.dnm?
- what are GL in cessna172r.dnm?
- what do if REL DEP not in dnm?
- shade using normals
- refactor rendering
	- primitives?
- fix render land texture (now it's half-assed)
- render terrain texture
- fog
- AABB for each mesh?
- AABB -> OBB?
- use coll.dnm files?
- figure out how to IPO the landing gear (angles in general), no it's not slerp or lerp
- animate landing gear transition in real time (no alpha)
- axis
	- better shader
		- no normals
		- no colors
		- refactor shaders
		- geometry shaders
	- select mesh/object
	- move selected (translation of axis)
	- show axis angels
	- rotate selected
	- move internal DNMs to resources dir
- all rotations as quaternions
- view normals (geometry shader)
- strict integers tokenization
- dnm hot realod per model

- optimization:
	- use smaller kinds of opengl primitives (i.e. strip/fan)

- audio:
    - mixing anything with propoller isn't loud enough
    - don't use SDL_MixAudioFormat
    - what to do with multiple playbacks of same sound? (ignore new? increase volume unlimited? increase volume within limit? ??)
    - use silence.wav to get correct silence value dynamically?

- parser:
    - read from disk?
